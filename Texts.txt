History :
The history of anime can be traced back to the start of the 20th century, with the earliest verifiable films dating from 1917.<br>

The first generation of animators in the late 1910s included <b>Ōten Shimokawa</b>, <b>Jun'ichi Kōuchi</b> and <b>Seitaro Kitayama</b>, commonly referred to as the "fathers" of anime.<br> Propaganda films, such as <b>"Momotarō no Umiwashi (1943)"</b> and <b>"Momotarō Umi no Shinpei (1945)"</b>, the latter being the first anime feature film, were made during World War II. During the 1970s, anime developed further, with the inspiration of Disney animators, separating itself from its Western roots, and developing distinct genres such as mecha and its super robot subgenre. Typical shows from this period include "Astro Boy", "Lupin III" and "Mazinger Z". During this period several filmmakers became famous, especially <b>"Hayao Miyazaki"</b> and <b>"Mamoru Oshii"</b>.

In the 1980s, anime became mainstream in Japan, experiencing a boom in production with the rise in popularity of anime.
